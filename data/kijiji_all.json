(Model: Elite 6.0L+)\r\n\r\nLooking for an affordable cell phone for travel purposes? This is it. Unlike the majority of smartphones available in the North American market which only incorporates a single SIM card slot, this model features dual SIM card slots, which gives users the option to carry 2 unique phone numbers simultaneously, and therefore gives you the choice to be on 2 different carrier plans. Alternatively, if you travel a lot, this is also a desirable feature should you need to use 2 different SIM cards depending on where you travel (saves you from carrying around 2 phones, or the need to carry extra SIM cards and need to swap them during your trip).\r\n\r\nThis Sky smartphone features a premium build quality (elegant design with cutting-edge metal casing which means there is some decent weight to it, doesn't feel like it's made of cheap plastic). Consists of 8GB internal storage (with option to add more via expandable memory slot), 1GB RAM to support memory-intensive apps, features a large 6\" IPS display, as well as dual cameras (13MP rear / 5MP front).\r\n\r\n***If ad is still up, the phone is still available for sale.

This is it. Unlike the majority of smartphones available in the North American market which only incorporates a single SIM card slot, this model features dual SIM card slots, which gives users the option to carry 2 unique phone numbers simultaneously, and therefore gives you the choice to be on 2 different carrier plans. Alternatively, if you travel a lot, this is also a desirable feature should you need to use 2 different SIM cards depending on where you travel (saves you from carrying around 2 phones, or the need to carry extra SIM cards and need to swap them during your trip).\r\n\r\nThis Polaroid smartphone features 8GB internal storage (with option to add more via expandable memory slot), 1GB RAM to support memory-intensive apps, features a large 5\" HD (16:9) IPS display, as well as dual cameras (13MP rear / 5MP front, both cameras capable of HD video capture). It is also one of the very few budget phones on the market in which both front and back cameras have LED flash (usually only the back cameras have flash).\r\n\r\n***If ad is still up, the phone is still available for sale.
